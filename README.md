# JD Sports Front-End Coding Test

This project has been created as a coding test for a job application at JD Sports Fashion as Lead Front-End Developer.

## Summary and Technical Details

1.- The page has been created using **Bootstrap 4** and **jQuery** as the main technologies in its development
2.- The carousel was created using an external plugin called **Slick**
3.- The **Mega Menu Demo** included on this page was coded by myself from the scratch, no plugin was used for this feature


### Prerequisites

All that's required to preview this project is to run the **index.html** file from a local or remote server able to process javascript and jQuery.


### How to...

1.- Use the **Mega Menu Demo:** Just hover your cursor over the menu item labeled **LATEST** and this will deploy the mega menu.


## Some considerations

Due to personal time and availability issues, some of the features related to the responsiveness of the menu and other minor tweaks haven't been completed.

The cumulative time spent achieving the current state of the page (**as per commit 4defe4d**) has been of around 3 hours and 15 minutes.
